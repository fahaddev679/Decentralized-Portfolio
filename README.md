# Decentralized Portfolio

Welcome to the Decentralized Portfolio Repository! This project presents a novel approach to creating and managing personal portfolios through a decentralized architecture. The application utilizes a combination of technologies, including Solidity, React, and Vite, to create a portfolio website that showcases skills, education, experience, projects, and other essential data. By leveraging a smart contract, all portfolio information is securely stored on the blockchain, enabling direct updates through smart contract functionalities. This README provides an overview of the Decentralized Portfolio application, installation instructions for dependencies, and an explanation of its features.

## Introduction

The Decentralized Portfolio project introduces an innovative way to manage and present personal portfolios. By utilizing Solidity for smart contract development and integrating it with React and Vite for the front-end, this application offers a decentralized and secure solution. Users can showcase their skills, education, experience, projects, and other portfolio-related data on a blockchain-backed platform. The smart contract ensures the integrity and immutability of the data, while the user-friendly interface allows for easy updates and modifications.

## Features

- Create a personalized portfolio website showcasing skills, education, experience, and projects.
- Leverage a Solidity smart contract for secure and transparent data storage on the blockchain.
- Make direct updates to the portfolio data using smart contract functionalities.
- Develop the front-end with React and Vite for an interactive and responsive user experience.
- Include sections for "About Me," resume, and contact information.

## Technologies Used

The Decentralized Portfolio application employs a powerful combination of technologies to deliver a seamless and secure user experience:

- Solidity: Develops the smart contract to store and manage portfolio data on the blockchain.
- React: Creates an interactive and user-friendly front-end interface.
- Vite: Enhances the development workflow by providing a fast and efficient build tool.
- Ethereum Blockchain: Stores and ensures the immutability of portfolio-related data.
- Other Dependencies: `web3`, `ethereum-waffle`, `chai`, `vite-plugin-solid`, and more.
